          <h2 id="list-title">A brief timeline of Aleister Crowley's life.</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="date">1875</span> - Born to a pair of deeply
              religious evangelical Christians in Warwickshire, England.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="date">1887</span> - Crowley's father, Edward, dies of
              cancer. This is the point of no return for Crowley, as he becomes
              completely hostile to Christianity and revels in the titles
              bestowed upon him by his own mother: "The Great Beast", "the
              unholy monster of the Apocalypse (Therion, 666)".
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="date">1896</span> - While on holiday in Sweden,
              Crowley had a "majoy mystical experience" originating from his
              first same-sex sexual encounter. This would be the start of his
              highly promiscuous life while enjoying all genders.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="date">1898</span> - Crowley is initiated into the
              Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn by the group's leader, Samuel
              Liddell MacGregor Mathers. He adopts the magical name of "Frater
              Perdurabo".
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="date">1904</span> - On a trip to Cairo, Egypt,
              Crowley claimed to have heard the voice of "Aiwass", his Holy
              Guardian Angel. During sessions of automatic writing this holy
              entity dictated the text of the 'Book of the Law'— the central
              sacred text that would form the basis of Thelema.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="date">1907</span> - Leaves the Order of the Golden
              Dawn and in collaboration with fellow occultist George Cecil Jones
              creates the A∴A∴, the Argenteum Astrum, through which they begin
              to build and propagate the religion of Thelema
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="date">1912</span> - Initiated into a German-based
              esoteric order, the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), and rose to
              become the leader of its British branch. He reformulated the
              branch in accordance with his Thelemite beliefs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="date">1920</span> - Founded the Abbey of Thelema in
              Cefalù, Sicily where he lived with his various followers. Their
              libertine lifestyle led to denunciations in the British press.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="date">1923</span> - Evicted from Sicily by the
              Italian government following the mysterious death of a young
              Englishman residing at the abbey.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="date">1947</span> - Died in Hastings, England at the
              age of 72. Crowley's last words were reportedly, "I am perplexed".
              The last doctor to have treated him died within 24 hours of
              Crowley's death— supposedly of a curse the magician had put on
              him.
